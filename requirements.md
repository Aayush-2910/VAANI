# Vanni - Voice-First Public Service Access Platform - Requirements

## Feature Name
voice-platform-core

## Overview
Vanni is a complete voice-first public service access platform that enables citizens to access government services through basic phone calls without requiring smartphones or digital literacy. The system uses open-source technologies to provide voice-based interaction with AI support and human escalation capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Millions of citizens lack access to digital government services due to:
- No smartphone ownership
- Low digital literacy
